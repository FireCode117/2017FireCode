code constitutes an additional set of fire safety regulations in the applicable jurisdiction. A local
fire code shall not and does not modify, repeal, invalidate or otherwise nullify any provisions of
this code or any authorities reserved for the state fire marshal under this code. Such local fire

local fire code, or parts thereof or authorize a variance or waiver to such local fire code by any
means, that provide a lower threshold of such safeguards or violate accepted engineering
practice involving public safety. Only the State Fire Marshal, in accordance with paragraph
(D)(4)( 104.8 ) of this rule or the state board of building appeals pursuant to section 3781.19 of
the Revised Code may authorize a variance to any provisions of this code. Consistent with this
paragraph, a political subdivision may promulgate fire code provisions that meet or exceed the
minimum safety requirements as set forth in this code.

premises subject to inspection by the fire code official, the fire code official is authorized to
require the owner or owner's authorized agent to provide, without charge to the jurisdiction, a
technical opinion and report. The opinion and report shall be prepared by a qualified engineer,
specialist, laboratory or fire safety specialty organization acceptable to the fire code official and
shall analyze the fire safety properties of the design, operation or use of the building or premises
and the facilities and appurtenances situated thereon, to recommend necessary changes.

(8) 104.8 Variances (modifications) by state fire marshal. Whenever there are practical
difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of the state fire code, the state fire marshal, in
the state fire marshal's discretion, may modify any provision of the state fire code or any other
administrative rule promulgated by the state fire marshal by issuing a variance upon written

state fire marshal and furnished to the applicant and the authority having jurisdiction, if said
authority is other than the state fire marshal.

(b) 104.8.2 Unless otherwise stipulated by the state fire marshal upon the granting of a
variance, each variance granted pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically terminate one
year from the date of its issuance.

(c) 104.8.3 There shall be no automatic renewals of any variance granted pursuant to this
paragraph. Each variance shall be specifically applied for in writing by the requesting party and
independently considered by the state fire marshal.
(d) 104.8.4 Variances issued by the state board of building appeals to this code shall be in

code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the
provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose
intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength,
effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. Where the alternative material, design or
method of construction is not approved, the fire code official shall respond in writing, stating the
reasons why the alternative was not approved. For the installation of any material or the use of

or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the fire code official shall
have the authority to require tests as evidence of compliance to be made at no expense to the
jurisdiction. Test methods shall be as specified in this code or by other recognized test
standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test methods, the fire code official shall

had a substantial risk of causing death or serious physical harm to any person(s).

(d) 104.10.4. As used in this section, the phrases "substantial risk" and "serious physical harm"

situation and to handle fire apparatus.

(b) 104.11.2 Obstructing operations. Persons shall not obstruct the operations of the fire
department in connection with extinguishment or control of any fire, or actions relative to other

spaces or areas to be used to determine compliance with this code or any operational constraints
required.

(c) 105.2.3 Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work
or operation shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of filing, unless
such application has been diligently prosecuted or a permit shall have been issued; except that

not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause
demonstrated.

(d) 105.2.4 Action on application. The fire code official shall examine or cause to be examined
applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws,

fire code official is satisfied that the proposed work or operation conforms to the requirements of
this code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the fire code official shall issue a permit
therefore as soon as practicable.

(3) 105.3 Conditions of a permit. A permit shall constitute permission to maintain, store or
handle materials; or to conduct processes that produce conditions hazardous to life or property;
or to install equipment utilized in connection with such activities; or to install or modify any fire
protection system or equipment or any other construction, equipment installation or modification
in accordance with the provisions of this code where a permit is issued. When issued, such
permission shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or set aside any of the
provisions of this code or other applicable regulations or laws of the jurisdiction.

(a) 105.3.1 Expiration. An operational permit, when issued, shall remain in effect until
reissued, renewed, or revoked or for such a period of time as specified in the permit.
Construction permits, when issued, shall automatically become invalid unless the work
authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work
authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the
work is commenced. Before such work recommences, a new permit shall be first obtained and
the fee to recommence work, if any, shall be one-half the amount required for a new
permit, when issued, for such work, provided that changes have not been made and will not be
made in the original construction documents for such work, and provided further that such
suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. When issued, permits are not
transferable and any change in occupancy, operation, tenancy or ownership shall require that a
new permit be issued.

(b) 105.3.2 Extensions. A permittee holding an unexpired permit shall have the right to apply
for an extension of the time within which the permittee will commence work under that permit
where work is unable to be commenced within the time required by this paragraph for good and
satisfactory reasons. The fire code official is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more

present to witness the acceptance testing of all fire protection systems.

(ii) 105.3.3.2 Final inspection. Prior to the issuance by the building official of any certificate of
occupancy for any building subject to paragraph (D)(2)(a)(104.2.1) of this rule, the responsible
person shall notify the fire code official to conduct a final inspection. The fire code official shall
report any deficiencies of the fire protection systems to the building official.
(iii) 105.3.3.3 Minimum conditions for safe occupancy. No structure, premises or building,
or any portion thereof shall be occupied unless:

(a) 105.3.3.3.1 Such structures, premises or buildings or portions thereof are in substantial
compliance with the applicable provisions of this code and the building code as referenced in
rule 1301:7-7-80 of the Administrative Code.

or permits are required and upon the request of the applicant, the fire code official is authorized
to issue a conditional approval or permit to engage in the permitted activity or use provided that
the permitted activity or use is safe and does not endanger life or public welfare. The fire code
official shall notify the applicant of any limitations or restrictions necessary to keep the regulated
activity or use safe. The holder of a conditional approval or permit shall proceed only to the point
for which approval has been given, at the applicant's own risk and without assurance that
approval for the occupancy or the utilization of the entire premises, equipment or operations will
be granted.

(e) 105.3.5 Posting the permit. Issued permits shall be kept on the premises designated
therein at all times and shall be readily available for inspection by the fire code official.

(f) 105.3.6 Compliance with code. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed
to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or any
other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the
provisions of this code or other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. The issuance of a
permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the fire code official
from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. Any
addition to or alteration of approved construction documents shall be approved in advance by the
fire code official, as evidenced by the issuance of a new or amended permit.

(i) 105.3.6.1 For structures regulated by the building code as listed in rule 1301:7-7-

certificate of occupancy for a structure in accordance with the building code as listed in
rule 1301:7-7-80 of the Administrative Code for a structure regulated by this code, the
responsible person is not exempted from compliance with this code, including provisions for fire
safety functions. If a review of fire protection system plans in accordance with
paragraph (D)(2)(a)(104.2.1) of this rule is not completed or a permit for construction is not
issued pursuant to this code, the absence of such review or permit does not prohibit construction
from occurring in accordance with the building official's approval.

(g) 105.3.7 Information on the permit. The fire code official shall issue all permits required
by this code on an approved form furnished for that purpose. The permit shall contain a general
description of the operation or occupancy and its location and any other information required by
the fire code official. Issued permits shall bear the signature of the fire code official or other
approved legal authorization.

(h) 105.3.8 Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to
be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of any
other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the
provisions of this code or other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. The issuance of a
permit based on construction documents, operational documents and other data shall not
prevent the fire code official from requiring correction of errors in the documents or other data.
(4) 105.4 Construction documents. Construction documents shall be in accordance with
this paragraph. The requirement for plan review of fire protection systems in structures
regulated by the building code as listed in rule 1301:7-7-80 of the Administrative Code
submitted for plan review in accordance with this paragraph is subject to and does not supersede
or otherwise conflict with the requirements of paragraphs (D)(2)(a)(104.2.1) of this rule.

it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that review of construction documents
is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code.

(i) 105.4.1.1 Examination of documents. The fire code official shall examine or cause to be
examined the accompanying construction documents and shall ascertain by such examinations
whether the work indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements of this code.

accordance with paragraph (D)(2)(a)(104.2.1) of this rule or construction documents approved
by the fire code official are reviewed and approved with the intent that such construction
documents comply in all respects with this code. Review and approval by the fire code official
shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of compliance with this code.

(i) 105.4.4.1 Phased approval. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (D)(2)(a)(104.2.1) of
this rule, the fire code official is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of part of a
structure, system or operation before the construction documents for the whole structure,
system or operation have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed
statements have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of
such permit for parts of a structure, system or operation shall proceed at the holder's own risk
with the building operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure, system
or operation will be granted.
(e) 105.4.5 Amended construction documents. Work shall be installed in accordance with

building code official having jurisdiction for approval in accordance with the building code as
listed in rule 1301:7-7-80 of the Administrative Code and to the fire code official for review in
accordance with paragraph (D)(2)( 104.2 ) of this rule.

(f) 105.4.6 Retention of construction documents. One set of construction documents shall
be retained by the fire code official for a period of not less than 180 days from date of
completion of the permitted work, or as required by state or local laws. One set of approved
construction documents shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site
of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.

(5) 105.5 Revocation. The fire code official is authorized to revoke a permit issued under the
provisions of this code where it is found by inspection or otherwise that there has been a false
statement or misrepresentation as to the material facts in the application or construction
documents on which the permit or approval was based including, but not limited to, any one of
the following:

(3) 122.3 Chapter 119. hearings: notice.

(a) 122.3.1 Written notice of intended action. Whenever the state fire marshal proposes to
take an action that the Ohio general assembly has expressly made subject to the administrative
adjudication procedure outlined in Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the state fire marshal shall
give notice of the intended action to the affected party informing the affected party of the
affected party's right to a hearing. Notice shall be given by registered mail, return receipt
requested, and shall, at a minimum, include all of the following:

(i) The specific action or actions the state fire marshal intends to take;

(ii) The charges or other reasons for the proposed action or actions;

(iii) The statute or rule directly involved;

(iv) A statement informing the affected party that the affected party is entitled to a hearing if the
affected party requests it within thirty days of the time of mailing the notice;

(g) A statement informing the affected party that at the hearing the affected party may appear
in person or through an attorney;

(h) A statement informing the affected party that the affected party or the affected party's
attorney may present the affected party's position, arguments or contentions entirely in writing,
and that at the hearing the affected party or the affected party's attorney may present evidence
and examine witnesses appearing for and against the affected party; and

(i) A statement informing the affected party that rules governing hearings in accordance with
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code are found in rule 1301:7-7 of the Administrative Code.

(b) 122.3.2 The state fire marshal shall also mail a copy of the notice to the affected party's
attorney or other representative of record. To qualify as an attorney or representative of record,
the affected party or the attorney or representative must notify the state fire marshal, in writing,
that the attorney or representative is to be designated the attorney or representative of record.
The notification must include the address where the state fire marshal should mail the notice to
the attorney or representative of record. The mailing of notice to the affected party's attorney or
representative is not deemed to perfect service of the notice. Failure to mail a copy of the notice
to the attorney or representative of record will not result in failure of otherwise perfected service
upon the affected party. In those instances where an affected party is a corporation doing
business in Ohio or is incorporated in Ohio, the mailing of notice to the corporation's statutory
agent pursuant to sections 1701.07and 1703.19 of the Revised Code will perfect service provided
that all the requirements of paragraph (A)(3)(a)(122.3.1) of this rule have been complied with.

(c) 122.3.3 When any notice sent by registered mail pursuant to this rule is returned because
the affected party fails to claim the notice, the state fire marshal shall send the notice by
ordinary mail to the affected party at the affected party's last known address and shall obtain a
certificate of mailing. Service by ordinary mail is complete when the certificate of mailing is
obtained unless the notice is returned showing failure of delivery.

(d) 122.3.4 If any notice sent by registered or ordinary mail is returned for failure of delivery,
the state fire marshal either shall make personal delivery of the notice by an employee or agent
of the state fire marshal or shall cause a summary of the substantive provisions of the notice to
be published once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in
the county where the last known address of the affected party is located. When notice is given
by publication, a proof of publication affidavit, with the first publication of the notice set forth in
the affidavit, shall be mailed by ordinary mail to the affected party at the affected party's last
known address and the notice shall be deemed received as of the date of the last publication. An
employee or agent of the state fire marshal may make personal delivery of the notice upon a
party at any time.

(e) 122.3.5 Refusal of delivery by personal service or by mail is not failure of delivery and
service is deemed to be complete at the time of personal refusal or at the time of receipt by the
state fire marshal of the refused mail as demonstrated by the state fire marshal time and date
stamp. Failure of delivery occurs only when a mailed notice is returned by the postal authorities
marked undeliverable, address or addressee unknown, or forwarding address unknown or
expired.

(4) 122.4 Chapter 119. hearings: request for a hearing.

(a) 122.4.1 Any request for a hearing made as the result of notice issued pursuant to (V)(3)(
122.3 ) of this rule must be made in writing and mailed or delivered to the state fire marshal in
the manner indicated in the notice issued pursuant to (V)(3)( 122.3 ) of this rule within thirty
calendar days of the following, as applicable:

(i) The time of mailing the notice if notice is given pursuant to paragraph (V)(3)(a)(122.3.1) of
this rule;

(V)(3)(d)(122.3.4) of this rule; or

(iv) The date of personal service.

(b) 122.4.2 If a request for a hearing is properly mailed to the state fire marshal, the request is
deemed to have been made as follows:

(i) If the request is mailed by certified mail, as of the date stamped by the U.S. postal service on
its receipt (PS form 3800 or any future equivalent postal service form).

(ii) If the request is mailed by regular U.S. mail, as of the date of the postmark appearing upon
the envelope containing the request.
(iii) If the request is mailed by regular U.S. mail and the postmark is illegible or fails to appear
on the envelope, as of the date of its receipt by the state fire marshal as evidenced by the state
fire marshal's time stamp.

(c) 122.4.3 If a request for a hearing is made by facsimile transmission or by electronic mail to
the state fire marshal, the request is deemed to have been made as of the date of its receipt as
evidenced by the receipt date generated by the facsimile transmission or the date of receipt
shown in the source code of the electronic mail received by the state fire marshal.

(d) 122.4.4 If a request for a hearing is personally delivered to the state fire marshal, the
request is deemed to have been made as of the date of its receipt as evidenced by the state fire
marshal's time stamp.

(e) 122.4.5 All requests for hearings must clearly identify both the affected individual involved
and the proposed action that is being contested.

(5) 122.5 Computation of time deadlines. Section 1.14 of the Revised Code controls the
computing of time deadlines imposed by Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and rule 1301:7-7 of
the Administrative Code. The time within which an act is required by law to be completed is
computed by excluding the first day and including the last day. When the last day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the act may be completed on the next succeeding day that is
not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. When the last day to perform an act that is required by
law is to be performed in a public office and that public office is closed to the public for the entire
day, the act may be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday.

(6) 122.6 Chapter 119. hearings: appointment and powers of a hearing examiner and
rules of practice.

(a) 122.6.1 Joinder of individual cases. On its own motion, or on motion of the appellant, the
state fire marshal or the hearing examiner may join any individual cases where there exist
incidents of common ownership or interest and where joinder would be appropriate for efficient
and economic fairness to the parties.

(b) 122.6.2 Computation of time deadlines. Section 1.14 of the Revised Code controls the
computing of time deadlines imposed by Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and rule 1301:7-7 of
the Administrative Code. The time within which an act is required by law to be completed by
excluding the first day and including the last day. When the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday,
or legal holiday, the act may be completed on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday. When the last day to perform an act that is required by law is to be
performed in a public office, and that public office is closed to the public for the entire day or
before its usual closing time for that day, then the act may be performed on the next succeeding
day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

(c) 122.6.3 Rules of practice in hearings conducted under this rule. In all hearings
conducted under rule 1301:7-7 of the Administrative Code where a stenographic record is taken
and where the stenographic record may be the basis of an appeal to a court of law, any person
not appearing pro se and any corporation, partnership, association, or other entity must be
represented by an attorney admitted to the practice of law in this state. The state fire marshal or
the hearing officer may permit persons authorized to practice law in any jurisdiction other than
Ohio to represent an appellant before the state fire marshal upon the motion of an attorney
licensed to practice before the courts of this state. When the appellant is represented by more
than one attorney, one attorney must be designated by the appellant as "trial counsel" and that
attorney is deemed the appellant's attorney of record and is primarily responsible for the
appellant's case at the hearing. No attorney representing an appellant is permitted to withdraw
from any hearing proceeding before the state fire marshal without prior notice being served upon
the state fire marshal and prior approval by the hearing examiner.

(d) 122.6.4 Authority of hearing examiners appointed by the department. The director
may assign a hearing examiner to conduct any hearing held subject to Chapter 1301:7-7 of the
Administrative Code. Any person assigned to be a hearing examiner must be admitted to the
practice of law in the state of Ohio and have such other qualifications as the director deems
necessary. The hearing examiner may be an employee of the department or under contract to
the department. The hearing examiner has the same powers as granted to the department in
conducting the hearing. These powers include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) The general authority to regulate the course of the hearing and to issue orders governing the
conduct of the hearing.

(ii) The authority to administer oaths or affirmations, order the production of documents and the
attendance of witnesses, call and examine witnesses in a reasonable and impartial manner, and
to determine the order in which the participants to a hearing will present testimony and be
examined in a manner consistent with essential fairness and justice.

(iii) The authority to pass upon the admissibility of evidence, and rule on objections, procedural
motions, and other procedural matters.

(iv) The authority to issue orders intended to facilitate settlement of the case, including the
scheduling of settlement conferences, directing the exchange of offers and demands, and any
other actions that may facilitate the prompt resolution of disputed matters.

(v) The authority to hold one or more pre-hearing conferences of the participants for the purpose
of resolving issues that can be resolved by the participants including facilitation of a settlement,
identifying the witnesses to be presented and the subject of their testimony, discussing possible
admissions or stipulations regarding the authenticity of records, identifying and marking exhibits,
and ruling on any procedural motions of the participants, resolving outstanding discovery claims,
and clarifying the issues to be addressed at the hearing, and discussing any other matters
deemed appropriate by the hearing examiner for the thorough and expeditious preparation and
disposition of the case.

(j) The authority to take such other actions as might be necessary to avoid unnecessary delay,
prevent presentation of irrelevant or cumulative evidence, prevent argumentative, repetitious, or
irrelevant examination or cross-examination, and to assure that the hearing proceeds in an
orderly and expeditious manner.

(k) Nothing in this rule, nor in any other state fire marshal rule, is to be construed as granting a
hearing examiner the authority to dismiss any hearing. Nothing in this rule nor in any other state
fire marshal rule limits the state fire marshal's authority to withdraw a proposal to enter an order
of adjudication or limits the authority of the state fire marshal to define the scope of any hearing.

(l) Upon the motion of the hearing examiner, the state fire marshal, or the appellant, the hearing
examiner may require the submission of briefs and memoranda at any time during the
proceeding. The hearing examiner may limit these filings to one or more specific issues and may
prescribe procedures and time schedules for their submission. All briefs, memoranda, motions, or
other pleadings are subject to the following requirements:
(a) All briefs, memoranda, motions or other pleadings must be filed with the state fire marshal
within three days after service. A certificate of service is to be attached attesting both to the
service of a copy of the pleading on the opposing party and the provision of a copy to the
hearing examiner. Service is governed by rule 5 (7/1/2007) of the Ohio rules of civil procedure
except that any reference to "court" in rule 5 will be interpreted to refer to the state fire marshal.

(b) Only those pleadings, order, and other papers filed with the state fire marshal will be a part
of the official record.

(c) All briefs, memoranda, motions, or other pleadings and papers must be on eight-and-one-
half-inch by eleven-inch paper and double-spaced.

(d) All orders, reports, recommendations, and rulings issued by the hearing examiner are to be
signed, dated, and filed with the state fire marshal.

Exception: A hearing officer shall not have the power to consider any motion for a change in
venue. Only the director or the state fire marshal or the state fire marshal's designee may
consider and rule upon a motion for a change of venue.

(e) 122.6.5 Withdrawal of proposed adjudication orders. The state fire marshal, upon its
own motion, at any time before the issuance of an order of adjudication, may withdraw its
proposal to implement such an order without prejudice to the rights of the parties.

(7) 122.7 Chapter 119. hearings: subpoena issuance and enforcement.

(a) 122.7.1 The state fire marshal, upon its own motion or that of any appellant, will issue a
subpoena requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and records as are
necessary for the purpose of conducting a hearing.

(b) 122.7.2 Upon the request of the appellant, the state fire marshal will issue a subpoena for
any witness of a subpoena duces tecum to compel the production of any books, records, or
papers. The state fire marshal will issue such subpoena in blank to a party requesting it, who is
solely responsible for completing the subpoena form, including the address where the person is
to be served, and returning it to the state fire marshal along with a written request for service.
The written request along with the completed subpoena must be received by the state fire
marshal no later than twenty-one business days before the commencement of the hearing or
deposition, unless otherwise ordered for good cause shown. Upon its own initiative and for its
own use, the state fire marshal may issue a subpoena for any purpose set forth in this rule or
otherwise authorized by law. At its discretion, the state fire marshal may make available
electronically a subpoena in blank and may authorize electronic submission of a completed
subpoena.

(c) 122.7.3 All subpoenas issued under this rule are to be directed to the sheriff of the county
where the person to be served resides or is found. The subpoena is to be served and returned in
the same manner as a subpoena in a criminal case. Fees and mileage of the sheriff will be the
same as that allowed in the court of common pleas in criminal cases. Fees and mileage of the
witness are governed by section 119.094 of the Revised Code. The state fire marshal will pay
allowable fees and mileage.

(d) 122.7.4 In case of disobedience or neglect of any subpoena served upon any person, or the
refusal of any witness to testify to any matter in which there may be lawful interrogation, the
state fire marshal will apply to the court of common pleas where such disobedience, neglect, or
refusal occurs for an order to compel obedience by attachment proceedings for contempt, as in
the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from such court, or a refusal
to testify therein.

(H) Section 408 Tornado shelters in schools

(1) 408.1 Pursuant to section 3737.73 of the Revised Code, principals or persons in charge of
public or private primary and secondary schools or educational institutions having an average
daily attendance of twenty or more pupils shall designate appropriate locations in their respective
facilities to be used to shelter pupils in case of a tornado, tornado alert, or tornado warning. The
designation of such locations shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed by the fire
marshal, as set forth herein. However, nothing in these rules shall be construed as requiring a
school or institution to construct or improve a facility or area thereof for use as a tornado
shelter, or to install a tornado alarm system.

(2) 408.2 Specific safety requirement.

(a) The fire alarm system shall not be used to alert building occupants of a tornado, tornado
alert, or tornado warning.

(b) The principal or person in charge of the school shall submit a clear, comprehensive, detailed,
and legible drawing to the local fire code official, showing the building floor plan(s) and
designated tornado shelter area(s). Each room or area shown on the plan shall be clearly
indicated as to its particular use.

(c) The drawing required by paragraph (H)(2)(b)(408.2) of this rule, shall be submitted to the
local fire code official for his information. A copy shall be maintained in the office of each school,
for examination by the state fire marshal or local fire code official.

(d) Tornado drills shall be conducted at least once a month whenever school is in session during
the tornado season. For the purpose of this rule, "tornado season" is the period from the first
day of April to the last day of July. A record of such drills shall be maintained in the office of each
school for examination by the fire code official.

(e) The occupants of modular classroom facilities shall be moved out of such facilities and to the
designated tornado shelter area(s) in the event of a tornado, tornado alert, or tornado warning.

(f) Each local fire code official conducting the annual inspection of each school or institution shall
be designated pursuant to division (C) of section 3737.73 of the Revised Code to verify
compliance with the tornado safety provisions of this rule.

(3) 408.3 Standards for shelter designation.

It is recommended that the designation of areas to be used as tornado shelters be in accordance
with the following criteria:

(a) Whenever possible, designate areas which are located below ground level, in the core of the
building, in rooms or spaces with short ceiling spans, and on the leeward side. The farther the
area is below ground level, the greater the protection. In any event, the area should be on the
lowest floor, in the center of the building, and in a corridor or small room.

(b) First aid kits and supplies should be in or close to the tornado shelter area(s).

(c) Avoid walls of glass, windows, skylights, and areas containing trophy cases or other fixtures
of glass.

(d) Avoid load-bearing walls and exterior walls, especially those on the windward side or facing
the south, southwest, or west.

(e) Avoid corridors which are not baffled with a wall or walls and that open to the south,
southwest, or west.
(f) Avoid an area with only one exit, unless overriding considerations should prevail.

(g) Avoid rooms or areas which are locked, since they may not be readily accessible during an
emergency.

(h) Avoid, absolutely, chimneys and the use of cars, buses, and modular classroom buildings.

(i) Avoid rooms or spaces with long ceiling spans, that are opposite openings or doorways that
lead into rooms with windows in exterior walls, or that are within the unprotected, falling radius
of higher building components.

(4) 408.4 General considerations.

Every building is different and contains some vulnerable elements that cannot be counted upon
to withstand a tornado. Portions of buildings that contain one or more of these elements should
be avoided wherever possible.

(a) Windows, skylights, and other components of glass, should be avoided. Glass is no match for
tornado force winds and usually breaks into many jagged pieces which are blown into interior
spaces from the windward side. Acrylic or poly carbonate plastics are more resistant to impact
than glass, but large panes will pop out. Tempered glass will shatter into thousands of cube-like
pieces that will be propelled by the winds like shrapnel. Windows at the ends of corridors,
particularly those facing south, southwest, and west, are very dangerous. They will probably be
blown down the corridor in a wind tunnel effect.

(b) Windward side walls, which usually are on the south and west, receive the full strength of the
winds. It is assumed that windows on these sides will be broken and blown into the rooms on the
windward side. This often results in increased air pressure, which aids in raising the roof.

(c) Wind tunnels occur in unprotected corridors facing the oncoming winds, which usually come
from the south or west. Openings facing these directions allow the winds to penetrate into
interior spaces. The winds apparently occupy almost the entire volume of such a wind tunnel, as
debris marks have been found to cover the full height of the walls. If entrances are baffled with a
solid massive wall, this effect is much less serious.

(d) Lightweight roofs such as steel deck plate, wood planks, or plywood will usually be lifted up
by the wind and partially carried away, with some roof debris falling below.

(e) Heavier roofs, especially precast concrete planks, may lift up and move slightly and then fall,
but not always returning to their original support location. If the support has collapsed, the
heavy roof may fall into the area below.

(f) Long-span rooms almost always have high ceilings. The exterior walls are usually higher than
the typical one-story wall. Often these walls, especially those with southern or western
exposures, will collapse into the long span. If they are load-bearing walls, the roof will cave in on
the area also. Avoid rooms such as gyms, auditoriums and cafeterias.

(g) Load-bearing walls are the sole support for floors or roofs above. If winds cause the
supporting walls to fail, part or all of the roof or floors above will collapse. The most dangerous
locations in a building are usually along the south and west sides, and at all corners.

(h) Masonry construction is not immune to wall collapse. Most masonry walls are not vertically
reinforced, and can fail when high horizontal forces occur, such as those caused by winds.

(i) [BE] 1004.1.1.1 Intervening spaces or accessory areas. Where occupants egress from
one or more rooms, areas or spaces through others, the design occupant load shall be the
combined occupant load of interconnected accessory or intervening spaces. Design of egress
path capacity shall be based on the cumulative portion of occupant loads of all rooms, areas or
spaces to that point along the path of egress travel

(ii) [BE] 1004.1.1.2 Adjacent levels for mezzanines. That portion of the occupant load of a
mezzanine with required egress through a room, area or space on an adjacent level shall be
added to the occupant load of that room, area or space.

(iii) [BE] 1004.1.1.3 Adjacent stories. Other than for the egress components designed for
convergence in accordance with paragraph (E)(6)( 1005.6 ) of this rule,the occupant load from
separate stories shall not be added.

(b) [BE] 1004.1.2 Areas without fixed seating. The number of occupants shall be computed
at the rate of one occupant per unit of area as prescribed in Table 1004.1.2 of this rule. For
areas without fixed seating, the occupant load shall be not less than that number determined by
dividing the floor area under consideration by the occupant load factor assigned to the function
of the space as set forth in Table 1004.1.2 of this rule. Where an intended function is not listed
in Table 1004.1.2 of this rule, the fire code official shall establish a function based on a listed
function that most nearly resembles the intended function.

Exception:Where approved by the building official, the actual number of occupants for whom
each occupied space, floor or building is designed, although less than those determined by
calculation, shall be permitted to be used in the determination of the design occupant load.

rule.

(a) [BE] 1005.3.1 Stairways.The capacity, in inches (mm), of the means of egress stairways
shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of
egress capacity factor of 0.3 inch ( 7.6 mm) per occupant. Where stairways serve more than one
story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the
required capacity of the stairways serving that story.

Exceptions:

1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches (mm), of means of egress
stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a

factors in paragraph (CC)(6)(c)(1029.6.3) of this rule indicated for stepped aisles for exit access
or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit
discharge is open to the outdoors.

(b) [BE] 1005.3.2 Other egress components.The capacity, in inches (mm), of means of
egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load
served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch ( 5.1 mm) per
occupant.

Exceptions:

1. For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches (mm), of means of egress
components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by
such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.15 inches ( 3.8 mm) per occupant in
buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance
with paragraph (C)(3)(a)(i)(903.3.1.1) or (C)(3)(a)(ii)(903.3.1.2) of rule 1301:7-7-09 of the

the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with paragraph (I)(909) of
rule 1301:7-7-09 of the Administrative Code.

3. Facilities with outdoor smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity
factors in paragraph (CC)(6)(c)(1029.6.3) of this rule indicated for level or ramped aisles for
means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress
from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.

(4) [BE] 1005.4 Continuity.The minimum width or required capacity of the means of egress
required from any story of a building shall not be reduced along the path of egress travel until
arrival at the public way.

(5) [BE] 1005.5 Distribution of minimum width and required capacity.Where more than
one exit, or access to more than one exit, is required, the means of egress shall be configured
such that the loss of any one exit, or access to one exit, shall not reduce the available capacity
or width to less than 50 per cent of the required capacity or width.

(6) [BE] 1005.6 Egress convergence.Where the means of egress from stories above and
below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress from the point of
convergence shall be not less than the largest minimum width or the sum of the required
capacities for the stairways or ramps serving the two adjacent stories, whichever is larger.

Urea (urea formaldehyde)

(d) 3203.7.4 Limited quantities of Group A plastics in mixed commodities.Figure
(C)(7)(d)(3203.7.4) of this rule shall be used to determine the quantity of Group A plastics
allowed to be stored in a package or carton or on a pallet without increasing the commodity
classification.

Figure 3203.7.4 Mixed commoditiesa,b
a. This figure is intended to determine the commodity classification of a mixed commodity in a
package, carton or on a pallet where plastics are involved.

b. The following is an example of how to apply the figure: A package containing a Class III
commodity has 12-per cent Group A expanded plastic by volume. The weight of the unexpanded
Group A plastic is 10 per cent. This commodity is classified as a Class IV commodity. If the
weight of the unexpanded plastic is increased to 14 per cent, the classification changes to a high-
hazard commodity.

c. Per centby volume = Volume of plastic in pallet load

Total volume of pallet load, including pallet

d. Per centby weight = Weight of plastic in pallet load

Total weight of pallet load, including pallet

(D) Section 3204 Designation of high-piled storage areas

(1) 3204.1 General.High-piled storage areas, and portions of high-piled storage areas intended
for storage of a different commodity class than adjacent areas, shall be designed and specifically
designated to contain Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV or high-hazard commodities. The
designation of a high-piled combustible storage area, or portion thereof intended for storage of a
different commodity class, shall be based on the highest hazard commodity class stored except
as provided inparagraph (D)(2)( 3204.2 ) of this rule.
(2) 3204.2 Designation based on engineering analysis.The designation of a high-piled
combustible storage area, or portion thereof, is allowed to be based on a lower hazard class than
that of the highest class of commodity stored when a limited quantity of the higher hazard
commodity has been demonstrated by engineering analysis to be adequately protected by the
automatic sprinkler system provided. The engineering analysis shall consider the ability of the
sprinkler system to deliver the higher density required by the higher hazard commodity. The
higher density shall be based on the actual storage height of the pile or rack and the minimum
allowable design area for sprinkler operation as set forth in the density/area figures provided in
NFPA 13 as listed in rule 1301:7-7-80 of the Administrative Code. The contiguous area occupied
by the higher hazard commodity shall not exceed 120 square feet (11 m 2), and additional areas
of higher hazard commodity shall be separated from other such areas by 25 feet (7620 mm) or
more. The sprinkler system shall be capable of delivering the higher density over a minimum
area of 900 square feet (84 m2) for wet pipe systems and 1,200 square feet (111 m2) for dry
pipe systems. The shape of the design area shall be in accordance with paragraph (C)(903) of
rule 1301:7-7-09 of the Administrative Code.

(E) Section 3205 Housekeeping and maintenance

(1) 3205.1 Rack structures.The structural integrity of racks shall be maintained.

(2) 3205.2 Ignition sources.Clearance from ignition sources shall be provided in accordance
with paragraph (E)(305) of rule 1301:7-7-03 of the Administrative Code.

(3) 3205.3 Smoking.Smoking shall be prohibited. Approved "No Smoking" signs shall be
conspicuously posted in accordance with paragraph (J)(310) of rule 1301:7-7-03 of the
Administrative Code.

(4) 3205.4 Aisle maintenance.When restocking is not being conducted, aisles shall be kept
clear of storage, waste material and debris. Fire department access doors, aisles and exit doors
shall not be obstructed. During restocking operations using manual stocking methods, a
minimum unobstructed aisle width of 24 inches (610 mm) shall be maintained in 48-inch (1219
mm) or smaller aisles, and a minimum unobstructed aisle width of one-half of the required aisle
width shall be maintained in aisles greater than 48 inches (1219 mm). During mechanical
stocking operations, a minimum unobstructed aisle width of 44 inches (1118 mm) shall be
maintained in accordance with paragraph (F)(9)( 3206.9 ) of this rule.

(5) 3205.5 Pile dimension and height limitations.Pile dimensions and height limitations shall
comply with paragraph (G)(3)( 3207.3 ) of this rule.

(6) 3205.6 Designation of storage heights.Where required by the fire code official, a visual
method of indicating the maximum allowable storage height shall be provided.

(7) 3205.7 Arrays.Arrays shall comply with paragraph (G)(4)( 3207.4 ) of this rule.

(8) 3205.8 Flue spaces.Flue spaces shall comply with paragraph (H)(3)( 3208.3 ) of this rule.

(F) Section 3206 General fire protection and life safety features

(1) 3206.1 General.Fire protection and life safety features for high-piled storage areas shall be
in accordance with paragraphs (F)(2)( 3206.2 ) to (F)(10)( 3206.10 ) of this rule.

(2) 3206.2 Extent and type of protection.Where required by Table 3206.2of this rule, fire
detection systems, smoke and heat removal, and automatic sprinkler design densities shall
extend the lesser of 15 feet (4572 mm) beyond the high-piled storage area or to a permanent
partition. Where portions of high-piled storage areas have different fire protection requirements
because of commodity, method of storage or storage height, the fire protection features required
by Table 3206.2of this rule within this area shall be based on the most restrictive design
requirements.

explosive weight of mass-detonating explosives (Division 1.1, 1.2 or 1.5 ) shall be used. See
Table 5604.5.2(1) or Table 5605.3of this rule as appropriate.

Exception:Where the TNT equivalence of the explosive material has been determined, the
equivalence is allowed to be used to establish the net explosive weight.

(ii) 5601.8.1.2 Nonmass-detonating explosives (excluding Division 1.4 ). Nonmass-
detonating explosives (excluding Division 1.4 ) shall be as follows:

(a) Division 1.3 propellants. The total weight of the propellants alone shall be the net explosive
weight. The net weight of propellant shall be used. See Table 5604.5.2(2) of this rule.

(b) Combinations of bulk metal powder and pyrotechnic compositions. The sum of the net
weights of metal powders and pyrotechnic compositions in the containers shall be the net
explosive weight. See Table 5604.5.2(2) of this rule.

(iii) 5601.8.1.3 Combinations of mass-detonating and nonmass-detonating explosives
(excluding Division 1.4 ). Combination of mass-detonating and nonmass-detonating
explosives (excluding Division 1.4 ) shall be as follows:
(a) Where Division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives are located in the same site, determine the distance
for the total quantity considered first as 1.1 and then as 1.2. The required distance is the greater
of the two. Where the Division 1.1 requirements are controlling and the TNT equivalence of the
1.2 is known, the TNT equivalent weight of the 1.2 items shall be allowed to be added to the
total explosive weight of Division 1.1 items to determine the net explosive weight for Division 1.1
distance determination. See Table 5604.5.2(2) or Table 5605.3of this rule as appropriate.

(b) Where Division 1.1 and 1.3 explosives are located in the same site, determine the distances
for the total quantity considered first as 1.1 and then as 1.3. The required distance is the greater
of the two. Where the Division 1.1 requirements are controlling and the TNT equivalence of the
1.3 is known, the TNT equivalent weight of the 1.3 items shall be allowed to be added to the
total explosive weight of Division 1.1 items to determine the net explosive weight for Division 1.1
distance determination. See Table 5604.5.2(1), 5604.5.2(2) or 5605.3of this rule, as
appropriate.

(c) Where Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 explosives are located in the same site, determine the
distances for the total quantity considered first as 1.1, next as 1.2 and finally as 1.3. The
required distance is the greatest of the three. As allowed by paragraphs (A)(8)(a)(iii)(a) and
(A)(8)(a)(iii)(b) above of this rule, TNT equivalent weights for 1.2 and 1.3 items are allowed to
be used to determine the net weight of explosives for Division 1.1 distance determination. Table
5604.5.2(1) or 5605.3 of this ruleshall be used where TNT equivalency is used to establish the
net explosive weight.

(d) For composite pyrotechnic items Division 1.1 and Division 1.3, the sum of the net weights of
the pyrotechnic composition and the explosives involved shall be used. See Tables 5604.5.2(1)
and 5604.5.2(2) of this rule.

(iv) 5601.8.1.4 Moderate fire-no blast hazards (Division 1.4 ). For Division 1.4 explosives
the total weight of the explosive material alone is the net weight. The net weight of the explosive
material shall be used.

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound = 0.454 kg.

a. This table applies only to the manufacture and permanent storage of commercial explosive
materials. It is not applicable to transportation of explosives or any handling or temporary
storage necessary or incident thereto. It is not intended to apply to bombs, projectiles or other
heavily encased explosives.

b. Storage in excess of 300,000 pounds of explosive materials in one magazine is not allowed.

c. Where a manufacturing building on an explosive materials plant site is designed to contain
explosive materials, such building shall be located with respect to its proximity to inhabited
buildings, public highways and passenger railways based on the maximum quantity of explosive
materials permitted to be in the building at one time.

d. Where two or more storage magazines are located on the same property, each magazine shall
comply with the minimum distances specified from inhabited buildings, railways and highways,
and, in addition, they should be separated from each other by not less than the distances shown
for separation of magazines, except that the quantity of explosives in detonator magazines shall
govern in regard to the spacing of said detonator magazines from magazines containing other
explosive materials. Where any two or more magazines are separated from each other by less
than the specified separation of magazine distances, then two or more such magazines, as a
group, shall be considered as one magazine, and the total quantity of explosive materials stored
in such group shall be treated as if stored in a single magazine located on the site of any
magazine in the group and shall comply with the minimum distances specified from other
magazines, inhabited buildings, railways and highways.
